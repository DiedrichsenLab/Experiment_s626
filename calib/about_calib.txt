		Robot suddenly lost calibration. Shoulder encoder seems to have flipped direction.
		Running calib matlab scripts gives bizarre fitting errors therefore I just manually set
		the calib file parameters (encoder direction/encoder offsets) to approximate values and that
		appears to work on-screen despite giving weird fitting errors. - Peter Zatka-Haas

		One of the carbon fibre rod's connection to the plastic holder came loose (glue snapped) therefore
		we reglued this joint, ensuring that the upper arm forms a parallelogram. We then recalibrated and 		it worked fine however the calibration routine only worked when tinkering with the encoder
		directions in the starting .dat file - Peter Zatka-Haas
